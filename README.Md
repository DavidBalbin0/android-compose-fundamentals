## ComposeFundamentals

This project is part of my Android development learning journey, focusing on exploring the fundamental user interface components of Jetpack Compose. Developed during my college studies, this project reflects my hands-on experience with key UI elements and state management concepts.

Throughout the project, I experimented with various components such as OutlinedTextField, Checkbox, and RadioButton to understand their functionality and usage in creating dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Additionally, I explored customization options for icons and implemented user input handling techniques like leading icons and keyboard options.

The project also provides insights into essential UI controls like Radio, CheckBox, Button, and TextFields, showcasing my exploration of available options to enhance user experiences.
